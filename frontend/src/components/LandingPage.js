      <ul>
        <li>Create text nodes that form a tree of personal expression.</li>
        <li>
          Optionally request an LLM response to add to the conversation (each LLM
          response counts toward our collective daily 1M token goal).
        </li>
        <li>
          Link nodes together to refer to previous entries and build a rich archive.
        </li>
